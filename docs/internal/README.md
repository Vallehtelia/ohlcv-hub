# Internal documentation

These folders contain **internal engineering notes** only — not part of the public user-facing docs.

- **changes/** — Changelog and implementation notes (per-feature, per-date).
- **llm-handoff/** — Planning spikes, handoff docs, and design notes.
- **process.md** — Process log (decisions, open questions, next steps).

For end-user usage, see the root [README.md](../../README.md).
